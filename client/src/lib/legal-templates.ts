export const SECURITY_AGREEMENT_EXPLANATION = `
Power in the Security Agreement:

A. Establishment of a Security Interest:

Creation of the Lien: The Security Agreement creates a legal lien on the Debtor's property, both tangible and intangible, whether currently owned or acquired in the future. This includes all assets, income, and property rights. By granting the Secured Party a security interest, the Debtor agrees that the Secured Party has a legal right to the specified collateral in case of default.

Precedent and Superior Claim: The Security Agreement explicitly states that the Secured Party's claim on the Debtor's property, particularly certificated securities like the Social Security account, is superior and precedes all other claims. This gives the Secured Party primary access to the collateral over other creditors.

B. Enforcement Rights:

Default and Remedies: In the event of default by the Debtor (e.g., failure to pay, breach of obligations), the Security Agreement grants the Secured Party the power to enforce their security interest. This can include taking possession of or selling the collateral without requiring court intervention (self-help).

Indemnification: The Agreement includes clauses that indemnify the Secured Party against harm or loss related to the enforcement of their security interest, ensuring the Secured Party is protected from financial harm.

C. Scope of the Collateral:

All-Encompassing Collateral: The Agreement covers all of the Debtor's tangible and intangible property, extending the Secured Party's control to a wide range of assets. This comprehensive scope ensures that nearly all assets of the Debtor are under the security interest, maximizing the Secured Party's protection.

D. Subordination and Public Disputes:

Subordination of Other Claims: The Agreement subordinates any other claims against the Debtor to the Secured Party's interest. This means that even in the case of public disputes or other creditors trying to assert claims, the Secured Party's claim takes precedence.

Protection Against Public Judgments: The Agreement also protects the Secured Party's interest against any public judgments that might arise against the Debtor, ensuring that such judgments do not interfere with the Secured Party's rights.

2. Power in the UCC-1 Financing Statement:

A. Public Notice of the Security Interest:

Perfecting the Security Interest: Filing the UCC-1 with the state gives public notice of the Secured Party's interest in the Debtor's property. This step is critical for "perfecting" the security interest, making it legally enforceable against third parties.

Priority in Bankruptcy and Insolvency: The UCC-1 filing establishes the Secured Party's priority in claims against the Debtor's assets in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. Since the Security Agreement is backed by the UCC-1 filing, the Secured Party has a legal advantage over unsecured creditors.

B. Collateral Description:

Specificity of Claims: The UCC-1 must clearly describe the collateral, which directly ties back to the Security Agreement. This description ensures that the Secured Party's interest is enforceable and unambiguous, covering all assets as described in the Security Agreement.

Protection Against Subsequent Creditors: By filing the UCC-1, the Secured Party's interest is protected against subsequent creditors who might attempt to claim an interest in the Debtor's property. The UCC-1 serves as a warning that the Secured Party has a first-in-line claim.

C. Legal Enforceability:

Framework Under Article 9 of the UCC: The UCC-1 financing statement operates under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which is a widely adopted legal framework for secured transactions. This gives the Secured Party a strong legal foundation to enforce their claims, even across state lines, if necessary.

Public and Legal Recognition: Filing a UCC-1 ensures that the Secured Party's rights are recognized by the public and in legal contexts. This recognition is essential for enforcing the security interest in courts or against other claimants.

Conclusion: The Combined Power of the Security Agreement and UCC-1:

Together, the Security Agreement and the UCC-1 financing statement create a powerful legal mechanism for protecting the Secured Party's interests:

The Security Agreement defines the terms, scope, and rights of the Secured Party over the Debtor's assets, establishing a broad and comprehensive security interest.

The UCC-1 Financing Statement makes this interest public and legally enforceable, providing priority over other creditors and ensuring that the Secured Party's claim is recognized and protected in all relevant legal and financial contexts.

This combined power ensures that the Secured Party has the first and strongest claim to the Debtor's assets, with the legal backing to enforce this claim in the event of any disputes or defaults.

export const EXPRESS_TRUST_PRINCIPLES = `
EXPRESS TRUSTS UNDER THE COMMON LAW

The Express Trust is not merely a property interest held by one for the benefit of another, but rather a private contract for the holding of a divisible property interest accepted by one at the offer of another, having full power to do whatever he may naturally do for himself as an individual sui juris, for the benefit of a third party of his choosing.

What has been created here is a trust organization, purely sui juris. "As a general proposition, it may be asserted that one who creates a trust may mold it into whatever form he pleases, and that whatever one may lawfully do himself he may authorize another to do for him," without receiving any benefit, privilege or franchise from any government or other outside-party; and, therefore they owe no duty to any government or other outside-party to the extent that no common-law criminal or civil wrong is the purpose of the contract.

Key Trust Principles:

1. TRUST CREATION AND BASICS
   - The Express Trust is created by a contract between parties sui juris (having full legal capacity)
   - Trust is established by Declaration of Trust, which serves as the "Charter" or "Constitution"
   - Trust offers protection from personal liability for its Trustees
   - Trust functions as a private contract under the Common Law

2. TRUSTEE POWERS AND DUTIES
   - Trustees may do whatever the Grantor may lawfully do for himself
   - Trustees must act according to the terms of the Declaration of Trust
   - Trustees have a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries
   - Trustees have the power to:
     * Collect, hold, and manage Trust Property
     * Sell, trade, encumber Trust Property
     * Invest and reinvest Trust funds
     * Enter into contracts on behalf of the Trust
     * Establish accounts for the Trust
     * Commence or defend legal actions

3. TRUST PROPERTY AND CERTIFICATES
   - Trust property must be properly transferred to the Trust
   - Trustees issue certificates representing beneficial interests
   - Certificates may represent capital interests or beneficial interests
   - Certificates are personal property of the certificate holders

4. TRUST VS. CORPORATION DISTINCTIONS
   - Express Trust is created by private contract, not by state charter
   - Express Trust is not subject to corporation regulations or taxes
   - Express Trust can operate with greater flexibility than corporations
   - Express Trust is protected under constitutional contract provisions

5. TRUST IN COMMERCE
   - Trust may engage in commerce as a legal entity
   - Trust creates commercial contracts with the outside world
   - Trust can obtain banking relationships, EINs, and other business necessities
   - Trust limits liability of its participants through proper trust structure
